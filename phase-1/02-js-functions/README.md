### Warm up - (5 min)

Warm up question:

What are functions and why do we use them?

```
Allow the creation of reusable code
Separation of responsibilities
Building blocks of JS programming
Allows us to structure larger programs
```

### Segment 1: functions & scope

#### Declaring a function

Using function keyword/function declaration - point out that this creates a global scope

This is where we can familiarize students with creating a function that runs upon page loading 

Create a function called `init` that will console.log('web page loaded')

```
function init(){
    console.log("page has loaded, run your program")
}
 
```

Change the console.log to a `return` statement and prompt students to think of ways to test this out for expected output. 

``` 
Store in a variable and console.log variable
console.log function invokation
Invoke function in console
```

Go over function declarations being accessible in global scope

Write a function called `createPokemon` using function expression 

```
const createPokemon = function(){
    let pokemon = prompt('Which pokemon are you today?')
    return pokemon
}

console.log(createPokemon)
```

Call the function without invokation to identify what exactly is being returned. Discuss what it means to invoke a function vs returning a function reference

Discuss anonymous functions and the restrictions of scope with these the previous and next examples by placing a console.log before the function declaration and before the function expression

Go over arrow functions

```
const renderPokemon = () => {
console.log('Rendering Pikachu!')
}
```

Ask students how this function can be made shorter

```
const renderPokemon = () => console.log('Rendering Pikachu!')
```

Talk about the side effects of the above code and how it hard coded and we want to write code that is reusable. So we can use parameters to pass in values as arguments that will be used in the functions program.
This helps our functions be more dynamic and reusable.

Pass a parameter to renderPokemon and use interpolation to dynamically log the different characters.

```
const renderPokemon = (pokemon) => {
console.log(`Rendering ${pokemon}`)
}
```

Can be re-written:

```
const renderPokemon = pokemon => console.log(`Rendering ${pokemon}`)

```
#### First class functions

What does it mean when we talk about first class functions?

It means that functions can be treated like any other object: they can be assigned to a variable, passed as values to other functions, returned as the value from another function

#### What is a closure and why is it useful

A closure can be thought of as the function that is assigned (or returned as a value) and its associated scope.

const createPokemon = function(){
    let pokemon = prompt('Which pokemon are you today?')
    return pokemon
}

#### Callback functions

Functions that are passed in as an argument to another function are called callback functions

```
const printPokemon = (name) => {
    console.log(`Today's popular pokemon is: ${name}`)
}

const capitalizePokemon = (name) => {
    console.log(`${name.toUpperCase()}`)
}

const createPokemon = (callback) => {
    let pokemon = prompt('Which pokemon are you today?')
    callback(pokemon)
}

createPokemon(capitalizePokemon)
createPokemon(printPokemon)
```
