# Data Types and Variables

### SWBAT:

- Create and manipulate arrays in JavaScript using array indexing
- Use for loops to access and manipulate data in arrays
- Use .map(), .find(), .filter(), and .forEach() to access and manipulate data in arrays

### Segment 1: Creating and accessing arrays

Go over what array's are and their use in programming:

```txt
- Arrays are ordered lists of values
- A collection of related data
- Each value represented in an array is referred to as an element
- Elements in an array can be of any data type and vary all at once
- Can save multiple values in one array
```

#### Create an array

Show students the two ways to create an array:

Array constructor 

```
let arr = new Array()
let arr = new Array(3) will create 3 empty places in the array
let arr = new Array(1,2,3) will create [1,2,3]
console.log(arr)
```

This can be problematic because of interpretation reasons so almost all the time, use array literal

Array literal - reader friendly

```
const pokemons = ['pikachu', 'bulbosaur', 'jigglypuff']
```

#### Access and update array elements using index

- Each element has an associated index
- Index numbers begin at 0 and increment per element in array 
- We can use this index to retreive values from an array 

``` pokemons[2]``` will return the third element in the array 

- We can use an index number to also update the element. 

``` pokemons[2] = 'Jigglypuff' ```

Ask students what the best way to access the following arrays last element would be. Drive the fact that it is a long array, we could not know the exact size and index of the element:

```
const pokemons = [
  "Bulbasaur",
  "Ivysaur",
  "	Venusaur",
  "Charmander",
  "Charmeleon",
  "Charizard",
  "Squirtle",
  "Wartortle",
  "Blastoise",
  "Caterpie",
  "Metapod",
  "Butterfree",
  "Weedle",
  "Kakuna",
  "Beedrill",
  "Pidgey",
  "Pidgeotto",
  "Pidgeot",
  "Rattata",
  "Raticate"
];
```

`pokemons[pokemons.length -1]`

#### .push, .pop, .shift, .unshift

Adding elements to an array:

.push() is used to add elements to the end of an array and returns the length of the array. Destructive 

```
pokemons.push("Spearow")
console.log(pokemons[pokemons.length - 1])
```

.unshift() adds one or more elements at the beginning of the given array. Returns length of array. Destructive 

```
pokemons.unshift('Arbok')
```

spread operator. Non destructive

```
let newPokemons = [...pokemons, "Pikachu"]
```

Removing elements from an array

.pop() will remove and return the last item of an array

```
let lastElement = pokemons.pop()
console.log(lastElement)
```

.shift() removes and returns the first item of an array

```
let firstElement = pokemons.shift()
```

.slice() can return a portion or copy of the array. Non destructive

#### Pass by value vs Pass by reference

    Make a copy of an array by creating a variable
    Show that mutations to the variable are still reflected in the original array 
    Make a copy using Array.from()
    Show that itâ€™s a unique array so mutations won't affect original

#### Access array using .find()

We can use find to return an element given a conditon. It will evaluate and find the first element that returns true for condition

```
let finding = pokemons.find((pokemon) => pokemon.startsWith('B'))
let finding = pokemons.find((pokemon) => pokemon.length < 7)
```
